Is a show like The Office a sitcom or a mockumentary? And what about Parks and Recreation? Is it a sitcom or a mockumentary too?</p>
<p>As it turns out, there’s no definitive answer to this question. The line between sitcoms and mockumentaries is blurry, and sometimes it’s hard to determine which type of show a particular comedy series falls into. In general, though, sitcoms generally follow a three-act structure and feature laugh tracks, while mockumentaries are more documentary-like and lack laugh tracks.</p>
<p>That said, there are plenty of exceptions to these rules. Some sitcoms don’t have laugh tracks, while some mockumentaries do. And some comedies fall somewhere in between the two genres.</p>
<p>So what exactly qualifies as a comedy series? There’s no single answer to that question, but in general, comedies are shows that make you laugh. They may be sitcoms or mockumentaries, or they may fall somewhere in between, but as long as they make you chuckle, they can be considered a comedy series.</p>
<h1 id="How-were-the-200-best-comedies-chosen"><a href="#How-were-the-200-best-comedies-chosen" class="headerlink" title="How were the 200 best comedies chosen?"></a>How were the 200 best comedies chosen?</h1><p>This list includes some of the best and most popular comedies of all time. How were they chosen?</p>
<p>To make this list, we started by looking at critic and audience ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. We then looked at how many times each movie had been added to IMDb’s “Best Comedies of All Time” list. We took into account the average rating on IMDb, as well as how often a movie had been added to that list.</p>
<p>We also considered other important factors such as box office revenue and awards. We looked at both critical and audience reception to determine a movie’s overall score. </p>
<p>Finally, we chose the top 200 comedies based on these factors. Some of these movies are classics that have been around for decades, while others are more recent releases. But all of them are sure to make you laugh!</p>

Given the vast number of comedies that have been produced over the years, it’s no small task to narrow down a list to just 200. But that’s exactly what BBC Culture did, polling critics from around the world to come up with a definitive ranking of the funniest movies of all time.

-->

<p>The list includes everything from slapstick classics like “The Three Stooges” and “The Marx Brothers” to more recent fare like “The Hangover” and “Bridesmaids.” Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>At the top of the list is Charlie Chaplin’s “The Gold Rush,” followed by Woody Allen’s “Annie Hall.” The late Robin Williams comes in third with his roles in films like “Dead Poet’s Society” and “Awakenings.”</p>
<p>In fourth place is Preston Sturges’ classic screwball comedy “The Lady Eve,” starring Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Other notable inclusions on the list include “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” “Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,” and “National Lampoon’s Animal House.”</p>
<p>There are plenty of surprises on the list as well, such as Japanese anime film “Spirited Away,” which comes in at number 18. And at number 34 is Cult British comedy classic “Withnail and I.”</p>
<p>So what makes a movie funny? According to BBC Culture, it can be anything from clever writing and sharp satire to slapstick stunts and goofy humor. But one thing all of these films have in common is that they make us laugh – sometimes until we cry.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Start watching some of these funniest movies of all time today!</p>

The list was created by taking into account IMDb user ratings. But why were these particular comedies chosen? What is it about them that has made them so popular?</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the success of these comedies may be that they appeal to a wide range of audiences. They can be enjoyed by people who are looking for a light-hearted, funny movie to watch, but they can also be appreciated by those who appreciate more clever and sophisticated humor.</p>
<p>Many of the comedies on the list are slapstick, such as “Airplane!” and “The Naked Gun”, while others are more dry and ironic, like “The Office” and “Arrested Development”. However, what they all have in common is that they are hilarious.</p>
<p>Some of the jokes in these comedies may seem dated now, but that only adds to their charm. They have stood the test of time and continue to be popular with audiences all over the world. So if you haven’t seen any of these comedies yet, then you should definitely check them out!</p>

However, the following 10 TV shows are some of the most popular and well-loved comedy series of all time.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Simpsons<br>This perennial favorite is a cartoon about a dysfunctional family of five who live in the fictional town of Springfield.

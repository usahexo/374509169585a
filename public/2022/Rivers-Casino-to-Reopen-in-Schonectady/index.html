<p>Rivers Casino is finally set to partially reopen this week, after being closed since early February due to flooding from the adjacent Allegheny River. The casino’s main floor will open at 8am on Thursday with 600 slot machines and 10 table games. The poker room and some other areas will reopen at a later date.<br>Craig Clark, senior vice president and general counsel for Rivers Casino says “we are excited to open the main casino floor and begin welcoming guests back to Rivers Casino… We appreciate our customers’ patience as we have worked to get our property back up and running.” The casino incurred significant damage from the Feb 5-9 flooding that also forced the closure of bridges leading to the property.</p>
<h1 id="Rivers-Casino-Closed-After-Cuomo-Sues"><a href="#Rivers-Casino-Closed-After-Cuomo-Sues" class="headerlink" title="Rivers Casino Closed After Cuomo Sues"></a>Rivers Casino Closed After Cuomo Sues</h1><p>The Rivers Casino, located in Schenectady, New York, has been closed after state officials filed a lawsuit alleging that the casino was operating illegally.</p>
<p>The casino is owned by the Mohawk Nation, which is an indigenous tribe in the area. The state contends that the tribe is not authorized to operate a casino under state law.</p>
<p>The Mohawk Nation has argued that the casino falls under federal jurisdiction and is not subject to state law. However, a judge recently ruled against the tribe, paving the way for the closure of the casino.</p>
<p>The closure of the Rivers Casino is likely to have a devastating impact on the local economy. The casino employs more than 1,000 people and has been a major source of revenue for the Mohawk Nation.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo hailed the ruling as a victory for taxpayers and vowed to take action against any other tribal casinos operating illegally in New York.</p>
<h1 id="Rivers-Casino-Set-to-Reopen-Friday"><a href="#Rivers-Casino-Set-to-Reopen-Friday" class="headerlink" title="Rivers Casino Set to Reopen Friday"></a>Rivers Casino Set to Reopen Friday</h1><p>Rivers Casino is set to reopen Friday, just in time for the weekend. The casino has been closed since February when a fire ripped through the building.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the fire, but the casino sustained significant damage. The casino is now under new ownership and has been completely renovated.</p>
<p>The casino will reopen with a new name, Rivers Casino &amp; Resort. The resort will feature a 132-room hotel, a spa, and a variety of restaurants.</p>
<p>The casino expects to draw many visitors from the neighboring states of New York and Pennsylvania.</p>
<h1 id="Rivers-Casino-in-Schenectady-Set-to-Reopen"><a href="#Rivers-Casino-in-Schenectady-Set-to-Reopen" class="headerlink" title="Rivers Casino in Schenectady Set to Reopen"></a>Rivers Casino in Schenectady Set to Reopen</h1><p>After closing its doors in February, Rivers Casino in Schenectady is set to reopen next week. The casino has been closed for more than two months as part of a $70 million renovation project.</p>
<p>The renovations include a new gaming floor, new dining options, and a new hotel. The casino is also adding 300 jobs to the local economy.</p>
<p>“The City of Schenectady is excited to have Rivers Casino reopen next week,” said Mayor Gary McCarthy. “The renovation project is impressive and will create 300 jobs in the community. This is another great addition to our city’s growing tourism industry.”</p>
<p>Rivers Casino is owned by the Oneida Indian Nation, which operates three other casinos in upstate New York.</p>

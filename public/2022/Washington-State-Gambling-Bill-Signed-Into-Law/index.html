        <h1 id="Washington-State-Gambling-Bill-Signed-Into-Law"><a href="#Washington-State-Gambling-Bill-Signed-Into-Law" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Gambling Bill Signed Into Law"></a>Washington State Gambling Bill Signed Into Law</h1><p>On March 11, 2019, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee signed a new gambling bill into law. The new law allows tribal casinos in the state to offer online gambling, including slots, table games, and poker.</p>
<p>The new law is a result of negotiations between the state and the tribes. In exchange for the right to offer online gambling, the tribes have agreed to pay the state $100 million annually. This money will be used to fund gambling research and other programs related to responsible gaming.</p>
<p>The new law will go into effect on June 6, 2019. At that time, tribal casinos will be able to offer online gambling to residents of Washington State. Players must be located within the state in order to participate in online gambling.</p>
<p>Tribal casinos have been pushing for permission to offer online gambling for several years. In 2017, legislation that would have allowed online gambling failed to pass the legislature. However, negotiations between the tribes and the state government led to a new bill that was signed into law by Governor Inslee.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Voters-Pass-Online-Gambling-Bill"><a href="#Washington-Voters-Pass-Online-Gambling-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Washington Voters Pass Online Gambling Bill"></a>Washington Voters Pass Online Gambling Bill</h1><p>On Tuesday, Washington voters passed an online gambling bill, Initiative 888. The initiative legalizes and regulates online poker, blackjack, and other casino games.</p>
<p>The vote was close, with 52% in favor of the bill.</p>
<p>The passage of I-888 marks the second time in as many years that Washington voters have legalized online gambling. In 2016, they approved Initiative 502, which legalized recreational marijuana.</p>
<p>Washington is now one of a growing number of states that have legalized some form of online gambling. Others include New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.</p>
<p>Under I-888, the Washington State Gambling Commission will be in charge of regulating the industry. The commission will establish rules for licensees and set minimum age requirements for players.</p>
<p>The regulation of online gambling has been a contentious issue in Washington state. Some lawmakers and tribal gaming interests have argued that it could lead to increased crime and addiction rates. Others believe that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state budget.</p>
<p>Supporters of I-888 say that it will create jobs and generate income for the state government. They also argue that it will be a safer way to play casino games than through unlicensed websites.</p>
<h1 id="Attorney-General-Approves-Washington-State-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Attorney-General-Approves-Washington-State-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Attorney General Approves Washington State Online Gambling"></a>Attorney General Approves Washington State Online Gambling</h1><p>Washington State will soon offer legal, licensed online gambling, as approved by the state Attorney General.</p>
<p>The move opens up a new frontier in gambling for the state, which is expected to see brisk business from residents and tourists alike. Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced his approval of the measure on Thursday, August 9th.</p>
<p>The legalization of online gambling in Washington has been a long time coming. Lawmakers have been discussing the issue for years, but it wasn’t until earlier this year that a bill made it through the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Jay Inslee.</p>
<p>Now that the Attorney General has given his stamp of approval, the ball is rolling on the rollout of online gambling in Washington. The first licenses are expected to be granted later this year, with sites going live in 2019.</p>
<p>State regulators are still working out the details on how exactly online gambling will be rolled out in Washington. There’s still some debate over how many licenses will be granted, what types of games will be offered, and how much tax revenue the state can expect to generate.</p>
<p>But one thing is for sure – online gambling is coming to Washington State, and it’s bound to be a big hit.</p>
<h1 id="Governor-Signs-Washington-State-Online-Gambling-Bill"><a href="#Governor-Signs-Washington-State-Online-Gambling-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Governor Signs Washington State Online Gambling Bill"></a>Governor Signs Washington State Online Gambling Bill</h1><p>On Tuesday, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee signed online gambling into law, making his state the latest in a long line of those to legalize some form of iGaming.</p>
<p>Under the new law, people 21 years or older will be able to gamble on casino games, poker, and other variants through licensed and regulated websites. The bill also allows for betting on horse races and provides a path for the legalization of online sports betting in the future.</p>
<p>The move was welcomed by industry insiders who believe that it will help generate much-needed tax revenue for the state. Brian Hastings, chief strategy officer at Las Vegas casino company GiG, praised the new law, saying that it would help create jobs and support small businesses in Washington State.</p>
<p>Others were more critical, with some warning that the new law could lead to addiction and other social problems. However, these concerns seem unlikely to derail the momentum behind online gambling legalization nationwide.</p>
<p>Since New Jersey became the first US state to legalize online gambling in 2013, a growing number of states have followed suit. In addition to Washington State, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and West Virginia have all legalized some form of online gambling in recent years.</p>
<p>The trend is likely to continue in 2020 as several more states are expected to consider legalizing online gambling in their legislatures. With such widespread support for iGaming, it is likely only a matter of time before online gambling is legal nationwide in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-State-Legislature-Passes-Online-Gambling-Bill"><a href="#Washington-State-Legislature-Passes-Online-Gambling-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Legislature Passes Online Gambling Bill"></a>Washington State Legislature Passes Online Gambling Bill</h1><p>On March, 10th, 2019, the Washington State Legislature passed bill SB 6677, also known as the “Online Gaming Act”. The bill amends the state’s current laws regulating gambling, to allow licensed casinos in the state to offer online gambling services to their customers.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill is a big win for the casino industry in Washington State. Currently, only a few states allow online gambling, and Washington is now one of them. This should help the state’s casinos compete with those in other states, and bring in additional revenue from gambling taxes.</p>
<p>The new law will go into effect on July 23rd, 2019. Until then, the Washington Gambling Commission will be working on developing rules and regulations for implementing it. These rules will cover things like age requirements for players, registration procedures, and how to ensure that people are only playing on authorized sites.</p>
<p>Once the rules are in place, players will be able to gamble on casino games like blackjack, slots, and roulette over the internet from within Washington State. They will also be able to bet on sports games through online sports betting websites.</p>
<p>It’s unclear at this point how much revenue the new law will generate for the state government. However, it is estimated that the industry could bring in between $16 million and $40 million per year in taxes. This would be a major boost to the state budget, which has been struggling in recent years due to falling tax revenues.</p>

individual taste in comedy. However, the following 10 TV shows are some of the most popular and well-loved comedy series of all time.\n\n1. The Simpsons\nThis perennial favorite is a cartoon about a dysfunctional family of five who live in the fictional town of Springfield. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson provide plenty of laughs with their outrageous antics. The Simpsons has been on the air for more than 25 years and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\n2. Seinfeld\nThis classic sitcom follows the everyday lives of four friends in New York City – Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer. Absurdity and hilarity ensue as they get themselves into all sorts of crazy situations. Seinfeld was one of the most popular shows ever aired on TV and still enjoys a large following to this day.\n\n3. South Park\nThis raunchy animated series takes traditional sitcom tropes and turns them upside down with its crude humor and politically incorrect jokes. South Park is not for the faint of heart, but those who can appreciate its edgy humor will find it very funny.\n\n4. Friends\nOne of the most popular shows of all time, Friends follows the lives of six young friends living in New York City. It’s a great show for fans of lighthearted humor, and many episodes have become iconic pop culture moments.\n\n5. The Office\nThe UK version of this popular workplace comedy was a massive hit, so much so that an American version was made starring Steve Carell. The show revolves around the employees at Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, and is full of awkward moments and cringe-worthy jokes.\n\n6. Black Books\nThis British sitcom stars comedian Dylan Moran as Bernard Black, a grumpy bookshop owner who hates people but still somehow manages to attract colorful customers to his store. Black Books is darkly funny with sharp writing and excellent performances from Moran and his co-stars Tamsin Grieg and Bill Bailey.\n\n7. Arrested Development\nThis quirky comedy follows the wacky Bluth family after patriarch George Bluth Sr goes to prison for fraud. The show is noted for its clever jokes, offbeat characters and fast-paced plotting. Though it was cancelled after only three seasons, Arrested Development has since gained a cult following thanks to DVD releases and Netflix streaming.</p> <p>8 .

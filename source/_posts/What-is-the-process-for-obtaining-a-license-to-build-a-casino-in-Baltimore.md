#  What is the process for obtaining a license to build a casino in Baltimore?

There is no one specific process for obtaining a license to build a casino in Baltimore. The Maryland Gaming Commission (MGC) is responsible for issuing licenses for casinos in the state, and the commission has broad discretion in determining who is eligible for a license and what requirements must be met. Generally, the process of obtaining a casino license involves submitting an application to the MGC, paying a fee, and meeting any other requirements that the commission may impose.

Applicants must be at least 21 years old and have been residents of Maryland for at least one year. The MGC also typically requires that applicants have some experience in the casino industry. In addition, the commission may consider factors such as the applicant's financial stability and criminal history.

The MGC has authority to issue up to five casino licenses in Baltimore. The commission has not yet announced when it will begin accepting applications or what the criteria will be for awarding licenses.

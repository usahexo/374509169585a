#  What qualifies as a comedy series?

There are many different types of comedy series, but what distinguishes them from one another? Is a show like The Office a sitcom or a mockumentary? And what about Parks and Recreation? Is it a sitcom or a mockumentary too?

As it turns out, there’s no definitive answer to this question. The line between sitcoms and mockumentaries is blurry, and sometimes it’s hard to determine which type of show a particular comedy series falls into. In general, though, sitcoms generally follow a three-act structure and feature laugh tracks, while mockumentaries are more documentary-like and lack laugh tracks.

That said, there are plenty of exceptions to these rules. Some sitcoms don’t have laugh tracks, while some mockumentaries do. And some comedies fall somewhere in between the two genres.

So what exactly qualifies as a comedy series? There’s no single answer to that question, but in general, comedies are shows that make you laugh. They may be sitcoms or mockumentaries, or they may fall somewhere in between, but as long as they make you chuckle, they can be considered a comedy series.

#  How were the 200 best comedies chosen? 

This list includes some of the best and most popular comedies of all time. How were they chosen?

To make this list, we started by looking at critic and audience ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. We then looked at how many times each movie had been added to IMDb’s “Best Comedies of All Time” list. We took into account the average rating on IMDb, as well as how often a movie had been added to that list.

We also considered other important factors such as box office revenue and awards. We looked at both critical and audience reception to determine a movie’s overall score. 

Finally, we chose the top 200 comedies based on these factors. Some of these movies are classics that have been around for decades, while others are more recent releases. But all of them are sure to make you laugh!

# The top 5 comedies on this list are: 

1) The Hangover
2) The 40-Year-Old Virgin
3) Old School
4) Superbad
5) Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan

In fourth place is Preston Sturges’ classic screwball comedy “The Lady Eve,” starring Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Other notable inclusions on the list include “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” “Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,” and “National Lampoon's Animal House.”

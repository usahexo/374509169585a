#  Massachusetts sports betting could be legal in 2019

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) held a meeting on Wednesday, December 12 to discuss a proposed amendment that would legalize sports betting in the state. The amendment, which is currently being drafted, would allow wagering on professional and collegiate sports.

A number of commissioners voiced their support for the amendment, with Chairman Stephen Crosby stating that he believes it has the potential to bring in “significant new revenue” for the state. If approved, sports betting could be legal in Massachusetts by 2019.

The MGC estimated that legalizing sports betting could bring in between $35 million and $90 million in annual revenue. This estimate was based on estimates from other states that have legalized sports betting, such as New Jersey and Delaware.

It’s still unclear how the revenue would be split among state agencies, but it’s likely that a portion would go towards funding public education and transportation initiatives.

The proposed amendment will now be submitted to the Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies for review. If approved, it will then be sent to the full legislature for a vote.

Opposition to Legalization

Not everyone is in favor of legalizing sports betting in Massachusetts, however. The Catholic Church has spoken out against the proposal, arguing that it could lead to addiction and social problems.

In a statement released on Wednesday, the Catholic Conference of Massachusetts said that it is “gravely concerned” about the proposal and urged lawmakers to reject it. The statement read:

“This isn’t about whether people should or shouldn’t gamble; this is about whether our policymakers think gambling addiction is worth creating and exacerbating for potentially significant new revenue…Addiction destroys families and communities; we urge our elected leaders not to pursue this path .”





#  Could Massachusetts lead the way in sports betting?

In a landmark decision on Monday, the US Supreme Court cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting, striking down a federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports gambling.

The ruling could potentially open up a huge new market for casinos and other gambling interests in Massachusetts, which has been studying the issue of sports betting for several years.

Governor Charlie Baker said on Tuesday that he planned to convene a working group to recommend regulations for sports betting in Massachusetts.

“The potential economic benefits of this industry are significant and warrant serious examination,” Baker said in a statement.

Supporters of legalized sports betting say it could generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state, and create jobs in the gaming industry. But critics argue that it could lead to increased addictions and social problems.

So far, only four states – Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana – have authorized some form of sports gambling since the federal law was struck down. But many other states are now moving to enact legislation, including California, New York, and Pennsylvania.

It’s unclear how quickly Massachusetts might move to authorize sports betting. The state has been studying the issue for several years, and there is likely to be strong resistance from opponents who argue that it could lead to social problems.

But with the Supreme Court ruling opening up the possibility for states to legalize sports betting, it seems likely that Massachusetts will eventually join the ranks of those allowing this form of gambling.

#  Sports betting legalization inches closer in Massachusetts

The Bay State has long been considered a hotbed for sports betting, and recent developments suggest that this may soon become a reality.

In July, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission voted unanimously to approve regulations for sports betting, paving the way for the industry to be launched in the state. This came after the US Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting in May.

There are still some hurdles to clear before sports betting can commence in Massachusetts, but regulators are hopeful that it will be up and running by the start of the NFL season in September.

One of the biggest questions facing regulators is how to handle wagers on college games. The Gaming Commission is still mulling over whether or not to allow bettors to put money on games involving schools located within Massachusetts.

Other states that have legalized sports betting are also wrestling with this issue. In New Jersey, for example, bettors are allowed to wager on college games, but only if they involve teams from outside the state.

While there is some resistance to legalizing sports betting in Massachusetts, poll results suggest that most residents favor it. A survey conducted by WBUR in July found that 57 percent of residents support permitting sports betting in casinos and racetracks in the state. Only 33 percent were opposed.

If approved, sports betting would generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state each year. In New Jersey, which launched its sports betting market in June, bets have already generated more than $67 million in revenue.

#  Massachusetts lawmakers to discuss sports betting legalization

The legalization of sports betting in Massachusetts is set to be discussed by state lawmakers in the coming weeks. The move comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting, opening up the possibility for states to legalize and regulate the activity.

While it is not clear if lawmakers in Massachusetts will be in favor of legalizing sports betting, there is likely to be some momentum behind the effort, given that other states have begun moving ahead with regulating the activity.

For Massachusetts, there are a number of potential benefits to legalizing sports betting. These include increased tourism and tax revenue, as well as the creation of new jobs. In addition, legalizing sports betting could help to protect consumers from illegal and unregulated activities.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it could lead to increases in gambling addiction and other social problems. However, proponents note that such concerns can be mitigated through effective regulation.

It remains to be seen what action lawmakers in Massachusetts will take on this issue, but it is likely that it will be among the topics debated in the coming months.

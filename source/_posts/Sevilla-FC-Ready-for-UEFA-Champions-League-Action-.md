#  Sevilla FC Ready for UEFA Champions League Action 

Sevilla FC, one of the most decorated clubs in Spanish football, is set to take on some of Europe's top clubs in the UEFA Champions League group stage.

Last year, Sevilla reached the UEFA Europa League final but lost to Liverpool. This year, they're out for revenge and are looking to make a deep run in the tournament.

Topping Group E won't be easy for Sevilla, as they'll be facing up against Premier League champions Chelsea, Bundesliga powerhouse Bayern Munich, and Belgian league winners AS Monaco.

But with a talented squad led by captain Sergio Escudero and manager Eduardo Berizzo, Sevilla is definitely capable of making it out of the group stage.

Some of Sevilla's key players include Wissam Ben Yedder, who scored twice in their recent win over Espanyol; Ever Banega, who was recently named vice-captain of the team; and Steven N'Zonzi, who was a key player in their Europa League victory in 2016.

Sevilla will kick off its Champions League campaign on September 12th when they take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. It'll be a tough match but Sevilla will be determined to get a good result against last year's champions.

#  Sevilla FC Wins Spanish La Liga Title 

For the first time in nine years, Sevilla FC are Spanish La Liga champions. The Andalusian side sealed the title with a 3-1 win over Granada on Saturday, putting an end to Barcelona’s dominance of Spanish football.

Sevilla were not the favourites at the start of the season, but they have enjoyed a superb campaign, thanks largely to their attacking trio of Kevin Gameiro, Álvaro Negredo and Vitolo. Manager Unai Emery has also been a key factor in their success, getting the best out of his players and creating an attractive style of play.

The victory over Granada was not without its nervy moments, as Sevilla went 2-1 down early in the second half. However, they battled back to take all three points and secure the title with two games still remaining.

Now that they have achieved their goal, Sevilla can focus on qualifying for next season’s Champions League. They currently sit in fourth place in La Liga, four points behind third-placed Atlético Madrid with a game in hand.

Sevilla’s fans will be hoping for more silverware in the coming weeks and months, as they look to seal a memorable season by winning both the Champions League and the Copa del Rey.

#  Neymar Jr. Joins Sevilla FC in Record Transfer Deal 

The 25-year-old Neymar Jr. completed his record-breaking move to Sevilla FC in a €30 million deal on Thursday, making him the most expensive player in the club’s history.

Neymar had been with Barcelona since 2013, when he signed for a fee of €57 million from Santos. He helped the Catalan side win a host of major trophies, including four La Liga championships and the Champions League twice. However, Neymar had been seeking a new challenge and decided to join Sevilla FC.

In a post on Instagram, Neymar said, “It is with great sadness that I announce my departure from Barcelona. I have never forgotten who has always been by my side and supported me both at Barça and Santos: my family, friends, teammates and fans. I leave feeling proud of what we have achieved together during these past five years”.

Sevilla FC’s president José Castro said of the signing, “We are very satisfied with this operation because it allows us to reinforce our team with one of the best players in the world”. He added that Neymar would be an important player for the club as they try to qualify for next season’s Champions League.

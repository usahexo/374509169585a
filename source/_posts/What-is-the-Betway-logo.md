#  How did Betway get its start?

To answer this question, we first have to take a look at the early days of online gambling. It all began in 1994 when Antigua and Barbuda passed the Free Trade & Processing Act. This allowed casinos to be set up on the islands, and it was not long before entrepreneurs were taking advantage of this new opportunity.

One such entrepreneur was Steve Beveridge, who founded InterCasino in 1996. This was one of the first online casinos, and it soon became a major player in the industry. Beveridge quickly realized that there was a lot of potential in online gambling, and he decided to focus his efforts on this market.

This was also the era of the dot-com bubble, and many entrepreneurs were riding the wave of speculative investment. Beveridge was no exception, and he raised $40 million for Betway Limited in 2000. This allowed him to expand his business and make it one of the leading players in the industry.

Betway has come a long way since its early days, but its success is largely due to the hard work and determination of Steve Beveridge. He saw the potential for online gambling early on, and he was willing to put in the hard work needed to make his dream a reality. Thanks to his efforts, Betway is now one of the leading providers of online gambling services in the world.

In a recent turn of events, Unibet has announced that they will be expanding their sports betting services to include Azeri operations. Starting in early 2019, Unibet will become the go-to for sports betting in Azerbaijan.

Finally, it’s worth mentioning that Unibet already has a very strong presence in the online gambling market. This should give them a head start when it comes to establishing themselves in Azerbaijan. So far, there are no other major operators competing in this market, so Unibet should have no trouble dominating the scene.

#  Get ready Arizona, Unibet is coming soon with full sports betting!

State officials confirmed that Unibet, a popular European-based online sports betting company, is preparing to launch its services in Arizona in the very near future.

"We can confirm that Unibet is coming soon to Arizona," said Stephanie Grisham, spokesperson for Governor Doug Ducey. "The company is currently in the process of obtaining all necessary licenses and approvals."

Unibet has been operational in Europe for more than 20 years and boasts over 10 million customers worldwide. The company offers a wide range of sports betting options, including traditional wagers on team results as well as more complex "in-play" bets that allow bettors to gamble on individual plays or specific moments during a game.

In order to operate in Arizona, Unibet will need to partner with one of the state's licensed tribal casinos. This is not expected to be a problem, as nearly all of the state's tribal casinos already offer some form of sports betting. In addition, Unibet has reportedly been in negotiations with several major casino operators in the state.

While there is no set launch date yet, industry experts expect Unibet to go live within the next few months. In the meantime, Arizonans can sign up for an account on the company's website and begin making deposits in anticipation of the launch.

Unibet, one of the world’s largest online gambling companies, is preparing to launch its services in Arizona in January 2019.

The company has obtained a licence from the Arizona State Gaming Commission and will offer full sports betting services, including a wide range of in-play bets.

Unibet already operates in more than 100 countries around the world, offering a range of products including casino games, poker and bingo. The company has been keen to expand its operations into the US market and believes that the opportunities in Arizona are significant.

The state of Arizona is one of just a handful of states that have legalised sports betting in recent years, following the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) by the US Supreme Court in 2018.

Other states that have legalised sports betting include Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia. Unibet plans to initially offer its services in Arizona via its website unibet.com, with plans to expand into other states if successful.

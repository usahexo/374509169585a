#  What Is A Full House Holdem Poker Hemingway?

In poker, a full house is a hand containing three of one rank and two of another rank, such as three kings and two sixes. It ranks below four of a kind and above a flush.

A full house is made up of a three of a kind and a pair. The rank of the three of a kind is always higher than the rank of the pair. The rank of the cards within the pairs does not matter. For example, 8♥8♦ would be the same as 2♣2♦.

If two players have identical full houses, then the player with the highest ranking three of a kind wins. If both players have the same high ranking three of a kind, then the player with the highest ranking pair wins. If both players have the same high ranking pair, then the pot is split evenly between them.

*Most people are under the impression that Texas Holdem is a difficult game to play. In reality, it's not that difficult if you understand the basic concepts. The objective of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards on the table. In order to achieve this, you must first understand how to play a full house holdem poker*.

*The most basic type of hand in Holdem is a pair. This occurs when you are dealt two cards of the same rank. If you are dealt two queens for example, then you have a pair of queens. If an opponent has two queens as well, then the highest ranking card (in this case an ace) would be used to break the tie.*

*If you are dealt three of a kind, then you have a three of a kind. In cases where two players have three of a kind, then the highest ranking card would be used to break the tie.*

*If you are dealt four of a kind, then you have four of a kind. This is a very powerful hand and should be played aggressively.*

*If you are dealt a full house, then you have three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. In cases where two players have a full house, then the rank of the triplet would determine who wins.*

*If you are dealt five of a kind, then you have five cards of the same rank. This is an extremely rare hand and should be played aggressively.*

*The final type of hand is called a straight. This occurs when you are dealt five consecutive cards (either all different suits or all same suit). If an opponent has a straight as well, then the highest ranking card would be used to break the tie.*

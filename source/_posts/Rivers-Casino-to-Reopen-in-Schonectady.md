Rivers Casino, which has been closed since early February because of flooding from the adjacent Allegheny River, will partially reopen later this week, a company spokesman said Tuesday.
The casino's main floor will open at 8 a.m. Thursday with 600 slot machines and 10 table games. The poker room and some other areas will reopen at a later date.
"We are excited to open the main casino floor and begin welcoming guests back to Rivers Casino," Craig Clark, senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. "We appreciate our customers' patience as we have worked to get our property back up and running."
The casino incurred significant damage from the Feb. 5-9 flooding that also forced the closure of bridges leading to the property.

#  Rivers Casino Closed After Cuomo Sues

The Rivers Casino, located in Schenectady, New York, has been closed after state officials filed a lawsuit alleging that the casino was operating illegally.

The casino is owned by the Mohawk Nation, which is an indigenous tribe in the area. The state contends that the tribe is not authorized to operate a casino under state law.

The Mohawk Nation has argued that the casino falls under federal jurisdiction and is not subject to state law. However, a judge recently ruled against the tribe, paving the way for the closure of the casino.

The closure of the Rivers Casino is likely to have a devastating impact on the local economy. The casino employs more than 1,000 people and has been a major source of revenue for the Mohawk Nation.

Governor Andrew Cuomo hailed the ruling as a victory for taxpayers and vowed to take action against any other tribal casinos operating illegally in New York.

#  Rivers Casino Set to Reopen Friday

Rivers Casino is set to reopen Friday, just in time for the weekend. The casino has been closed since February when a fire ripped through the building.

No one was injured in the fire, but the casino sustained significant damage. The casino is now under new ownership and has been completely renovated.

The casino will reopen with a new name, Rivers Casino & Resort. The resort will feature a 132-room hotel, a spa, and a variety of restaurants.

The casino expects to draw many visitors from the neighboring states of New York and Pennsylvania.

After closing its doors in February, Rivers Casino in Schenectady is set to reopen next week. The casino has been closed for more than two months as part of a $70 million renovation project.

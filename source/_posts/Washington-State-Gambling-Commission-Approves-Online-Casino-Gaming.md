#  Washington State Gambling Commission Approves Online Casino Gaming

On January 8, 2019, the Washington State Gambling Commission (WSGC) unanimously approved rules to allow online casino gaming in the state.

The new regulations will take effect on July 1, 2019, and will allow qualified operators to offer online casino games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette.

Players must be physically located in Washington State to gamble on the websites of approved operators.

According to WSGC Executive Director David Trujillo, "These rules provide a clear framework for licensed operators wishing to offer online casino games to our citizens. We believe this new industry will create jobs and generate revenue for the state."

Several companies have already expressed interest in obtaining licenses to operate online casinos in Washington State, including Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts International.

The approval of online casino gaming is good news for the gambling industry in Washington State, which has seen declining revenues in recent years. In 2018, total gambling revenues in the state were estimated at $811 million, down from $882 million in 2017.

#  Washington State Online Gambling Bill Signed Into Law

On March 10, 2018, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee signed a bill into law legalizing online gambling in the state. The new law allows licensed operators to offer casino games, poker, and sports betting to residents of Washington over the age of 21.

The passage of the bill was seen as a victory by the gambling industry, which has been pushing for greater legalization in recent years. “This is a watershed moment for the gaming industry in the United States,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to money problems for consumers. However, supporters say that it can be a safe and fun way to gamble, and that it can help generate revenue for states.

Washington is now the fourth state to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada. Other states are expected to follow suit in the coming years.

#  Washington Becomes Fourth State To Legalize Online Gambling

On Tuesday, Washington Governor Jay Inslee signed a bill into law legalizing online gambling in the state. The new law will go into effect on June 6th, making Washington the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling.

Under the new law, online poker and casino games will be legal in Washington, with operators required to pay a licensing fee and taxes on revenue. The state is also planning to launch its own online gambling site, which will offer poker, blackjack, and other casino games.

Online gambling has been illegal in most of the US since 2006, when Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). However, a number of states have since moved to legalize online gambling, including New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware.

Supporters of online gambling say it will help generate tax revenue for states and create jobs in the gaming industry. However, opponents argue that it can lead to addiction and social problems.

#  Washington State Legalizes Online Gambling, Nevada Follows Suit

In February of 2018, the state of Washington became the first in the U.S. to legalize online gambling. The news was quickly followed by Nevada making a similar move, legalizing most forms of gambling with the exception of sports betting.

The unanimous vote in Washington’s state Senate was seen as a historic victory for the casino industry and supporters of online gambling. Backers say that legalizing it will bring in new revenue to the state, as well as create jobs.

Opponents of online gambling, which include some religious groups, say that it can be addictive and lead to money problems for people who gamble too much. They also point out that there is no age limit for those who can gamble online, which could put children at risk.

Despite those concerns, states are moving ahead with legalization as they see the potential benefits outweighing any risks. Nevada’s move is seen as significant because it is home to many major casinos and has been traditionally resistant to change when it comes to gambling laws.

With more states likely to legalize online gambling in the coming years, the industry is poised for rapid growth. That growth is sure to bring with it new opportunities and challenges, as lawmakers, casino operators, and players all grapple with how best to take advantage of this rapidly expanding market.

#  Washington becomes first state to legalize, regulate and tax online gambling

“Washington has become the first state in the US to legalize, regulate and tax online gambling. Governor Jay Inslee signed Senate Bill 6628 into law on Monday, making it legal for people aged 21 and over to gamble online starting from June 6th, 2019. The new law establishes a framework for licensing operators and regulating the industry. It also imposes a 20% tax on revenue generated from online gambling.

Supporters of the bill say it will generate much-needed revenue for the state, while opponents argue that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling. Democratic Senator Margarita Prentice, a key backer of the bill, said: “The passage of SB 6628 means that Washington is taking an important step forward in regulating a growing industry and generating much-needed revenue for our state. I am proud that our state is leading the way on this issue.”

The new law marks a major shift in policy for Washington, which previously had no regulations governing online gambling. Under the new law, operators will be required to pay fees and undergo criminal background checks. They will also be banned from offering certain types of betting, including sports betting and casino games such as blackjack and roulette.

Washington is not the first state to legalize online gambling – Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey have all done so – but it is the largest to date. Other states are expected to follow suit, as more and more Americans move away from traditional forms of gambling such as casinos and lotteries.”

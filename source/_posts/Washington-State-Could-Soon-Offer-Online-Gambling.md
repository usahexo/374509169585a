#  Washington State Could Soon Offer Online Gambling

The state of Washington is considering the legalization of online gambling, which would allow people within the state to gamble online.

This proposal has been under consideration for a few years now, but it seems like it may finally be moving forward. There are a few different bills that have been introduced in the legislature, and they all aim to legalize some form of online gambling.

There are a few reasons why legalizing online gambling could be a good idea for Washington. For starters, it would generate revenue for the state. Gambling is already popular in Washington, so it makes sense to legalize and regulate it. This would also create jobs and help the economy in general.

Another benefit of legalizing online gambling is that it would help protect citizens from scam artists. There are already many illegal websites that offer gambling, and these sites are often scams. By legalizing online gambling, the state would be able to regulate these websites and ensure that players are safe.

There are some potential drawbacks to legalizing online gambling, however. One concern is that it could lead to addiction problems for some people. Another concern is that it could be used by criminals to launder money.

Despite these concerns, it seems likely that online gambling will be legalized in Washington in the near future. This would be good news for players in the state, as they would have access to safe and regulated gambling options.

#  Washington Becomes Latest State to Legalize Online Gambling

On Tuesday, February 26th, 2019, the state of Washington became the latest to legalize online gambling. This follows in the footsteps of several other states who have also legalized online gambling in recent years, including New Jersey, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.

The new law allows licensed casinos in Washington to offer online gambling services to residents of the state. These services will include both casino games and sports betting. The hope is that this will help generate additional revenue for the state’s casinos, which have been struggling in recent years.

Online gambling is already a huge industry in the United States. In fact, it is estimated that Americans spend more than $200 billion a year on gambling activities. This includes both online and offline gambling. So it’s not surprising that states are starting to legalize online gambling as a way to generate additional revenue.

There are some who are opposed to online gambling, arguing that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for those who participate in it. But there is also evidence that online gambling can be safely enjoyed by adults who choose to do so responsibly.

Ultimately, it will be up to each individual state to decide whether or not to legalize online gambling. But with so many states now moving in that direction, it seems likely that online gambling will continue to grow in popularity in the years ahead.

#  Washington to Allow Online Gambling by Year's End

According to recent reports, the state of Washington is moving towards legalizing and regulating online gambling by the end of the year. The proposed legislation would allow licensed operators to offer a range of casino games, including slots, blackjack and roulette, to players within the state's borders.

The move is seen as a way to bring in much-needed revenue for the cash-strapped state, with officials estimating that it could generate up to $100 million in annual tax revenue. It would also create new jobs in the online gambling industry, which is currently worth an estimated $40 billion globally.

Washington is not the only state to consider legalizing online gambling in recent months; New Jersey, Delaware and Nevada all have similar proposals in the works. However, given Washington's close proximity to Oregon and Canada (both of which have strong online gambling industries), it is likely that this state will eventually be one of the first to fully legalize and regulate the activity.

#  Washington Poised to Legalize Online Gambling in 2017

Washington lawmakers are primed to pass a bill in early 2017 legalizing online gambling within the Evergreen State.

The arrival of online gambling in Washington will mark an important development in the ongoing struggle between states seeking new sources of revenue and the federal government, which has thus far declined to legalize and regulate the activity.

Washington state officials anticipate that online gambling will bring in over $100 million in new revenue each year, making it a key piece of the state’s budget puzzle. The move is also expected to create thousands of jobs within the state’s newly legalized industry.

Online gambling is already prevalent within Washington state, with residents spending over $500 million per year on foreign websites. Passage of a bill legalizing and regulating the activity within the state will provide much-needed consumer protections and ensure that tax revenue from gambling is funneled back into state coffers.

It remains to be seen whether other states will follow Washington’s lead in legalizing online gambling, but with many facing similar budget woes, it is likely that this is only the beginning of a nationwide trend.

#  Washington Eyeing Online Gambling legalization in Early 2017

State lawmakers in Washington are contemplating introducing a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling in the state early next year.

If passed, the bill would allow for licensed operators to offer a range of online gambling products to players within the state, including casino games, poker, and sports betting. It would also impose a number of regulatory controls on these operators, including age verification measures and restrictions on how much players could bet each day.

The measure is seen as a way to bring additional tax revenue into the state government, with supporters estimating that it could raise as much as $100 million per year. It would also create jobs in the online gambling industry, which is estimated to grow rapidly if the bill is passed.

Critics of the measure argue that it could lead to increased problem gambling rates in the state, but supporters argue that this can be mitigated by implementing responsible gambling measures.

Washington is not the only state considering legalizing online gambling in 2017 – several others, including New York and Illinois, are also debating similar proposals.

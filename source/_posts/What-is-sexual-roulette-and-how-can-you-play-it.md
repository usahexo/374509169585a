#  What is sexual roulette and how can you play it?

In a nutshell, sexual roulette is a high stakes game where you and your partner take turns spinning a bottle or drawing cards to see who gets to have sex with the other first. Generally, the game is played with two people who are equally attracted to each other, but it can be modified to include more players.

If you're looking for a way to add some excitement and anticipation to your sex life, then give sexual roulette a try. It can be a fun way to break out of your routine and get your partner excited about what's coming up next.

The rules of the game are simple. Spin the bottle or draw cards until someone's number or symbol is called out. That person then has to have sex with the person who called out their number or symbol. If you're feeling daring, you can even make up your own rules as you go along.

One thing to keep in mind is that sexual roulette can be risky if you're not careful. Make sure that both you and your partner are comfortable with the activities that will be taking place and that you have discussed any boundaries or limits beforehand.

If you're looking for a new way to add intrigue and excitement to your sex life, then give sexual roulette a try today!

#  The dangers of playing sexual roulette

There’s a game going around campus that some people are calling “sexual roulette.” It’s simple - each player takes turns spinning the bottle, and when it points to someone, they have to have sex with that person. 

At first glance, the game might seem like harmless fun, but there are a lot of dangers lurking beneath the surface. Here are just a few of the risks associated with playing sexual roulette:

1. You might not be attracted to the person the bottle points to.

What if you end up having to sleep with someone you’re not attracted to? Not only is this uncomfortable for both parties involved, but it can also be emotionally damaging.

2. You might not be physically compatible with the person the bottle points to.

Just because two people are attracted to each other doesn’t mean they’ll be compatible in bed. If you end up sleeping with someone and you don’t mesh well together, it can be really painful and frustrating.

3. You might not have safe sex with the person the bottle points to.

This one is obviously a major concern - if you don’t know your partner’s sexual history, there’s a good chance you could end up getting an STI from them. Not only is this potentially life-altering, but it can also be really expensive to treat.

4. You might get caught in the middle of a friends rivalry.

What happens if two people who are friends end up having to sleep with each other as part of the game? Chances are high that things will get really messy, really fast - and that could potentially ruin friendships for years to come.

#  How to make your next game of sexual roulette even more thrilling 

A game of sexual roulette can add excitement to any sex session, but you can make it even more thrilling by adding some new rules. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. Change the location

If you normally have sex in the bedroom, why not try something different? The living room, kitchen, or even outdoors could add a new level of excitement to your game.

2. Add new challenges

Adding new challenges can keep things exciting. For example, you could try withholding orgasm until a certain task is completed or using restraints for a certain amount of time.

3. Use sex toys

Adding sex toys can also ramp up the excitement levels. Whether you use them on each other or incorporate them into the game itself, they can provide an extra layer of fun and pleasure.

4. Take turns pleasuring each other

Another way to add excitement is to take turns pleasuring each other. This can be done with oral sex, fingering, and even using sex toys. It can be especially thrilling if one partner isn’t allowed to come until the other has had multiple orgasms.

#  NL West Showdown: Which Game is Toughest to Win?

The NL West is one of the most competitive divisions in all of baseball. There are four teams in the division that have a legitimate chance to make the playoffs and the San Diego Padres are not one of them. The Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, Arizona Diamondbacks, and San Francisco Giants are all evenly matched and it is difficult to predict who will come out on top.

The Dodgers are the current favorites to win the division, but they are not without their flaws. They struggled early in the season, but they seem to be back on track now. The Rockies had a hot start to the season, but they have cooled off recently. The Diamondbacks have been inconsistent this year, but they still have a chance to make a run at the playoffs. The Giants have been playing well lately, but they are still trailing the other teams in the division.

All four of these teams have talented players and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top. The Dodgers have Clayton Kershaw and Yu Darvish at the top of their rotation and they also have Cody Bellinger and Justin Turner in their lineup. The Rockies have Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon at the top of their lineup and they also have a strong bullpen. The Diamondbacks have Paul Goldschmidt and A.J. Pollock in their lineup and they also have Zack Greinke and Robbie Ray as starters. The Giants have Buster Posey and Hunter Pence in their lineup and they also have Madison Bumgarner and Johnny Cueto in their rotation.

It is going to be a tight race for the NL West crown and any of these teams could win it. The Dodgers appear to be the favorite right now, but they could easily fall behind if they do not start playing better soon. The Rockies, Diamondbacks, and Giants all pose a serious threat to them and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top

#  Baseball's Best 21: Who Reigns Supreme in the NL West?

The NL West is one of the most competitive divisions in baseball. The Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, and San Diego Padres are all vying for the top spot. Who is the best team in the NL West?

The Los Angeles Dodgers have the best record in the NL West and are one of the best teams in baseball. Led by Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers have a dominant pitching staff. The offense is led by Justin Turner and Cody Bellinger. The Dodgers will be tough to beat in the playoffs.

The Arizona Diamondbacks are a close second to the Dodgers. They have an excellent pitching staff, led by Zack Greinke and Robbie Ray. Paul Goldschmidt is their biggest offensive threat. If they can stay healthy, they could make a deep playoff run.

The Colorado Rockies are third in the NL West. They have a potent lineup, led by Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon. The Rockies are also strong on the mound with Jon Gray and Tyler Anderson leading the way. They could make some noise in the playoffs if they get hot at the right time.

Fourth place in the NL West belongs to the San Diego Padres. They have a young roster with lots of potential. Manny Machado is their biggest superstar and will look to lead them to victory this season. However, they still have some work to do before they can compete with the top teams in their division.

Who will come out on top in the NL West? It's anyone's guess at this point, but it's sure to be an exciting race all season long!

#  Points Race Heats Up in NL West: Who is Gambling on the Fastest Route to 21?

After a while of cautious movement, the National League West division has seen a recent rush to be the first to 21 points. The Dodgers, Giants and Rockies have all been making moves in an effort to gain an early lead.

The Dodgers started things off when they acquired Manny Machado from the Orioles on July 18th. This move put them in prime position to make a playoff push and win the division. Machado gives the Dodgers another bat in their lineup as well as some much needed defense at shortstop.

The Giants reacted to the Dodgers move by trading for Andrew McCutchen from the Pirates on August 31st. McCutchen provides another power bat in the lineup as well as some veteran leadership. He is also used to playing in a big market and should help the Giants with their playoff push.

The Rockies were not content to just stand by and watch these two teams make moves. They reacted by acquiring Nolan Arenado from the Diamondbacks on July 31st. This gave them one of the best infields in all of baseball with Arenado, Trevor Story, DJ LeMahieu, and Chris Iannetta.

These three teams are all gambling on making a fast run to 21 points so that they can clinch the division title early. Whoever manages to do this will have an advantage going into the playoffs.
